### Features Left to Implement



## Testing

### Responsiveness 

Throughout the site is tested to ensure all pages are displayed appropriately in all screen sizes


### Manual and Automated testing

**Responsiveness**


**Testing**

  Manual testing was carried out to ensure the site works as intended. Testing document can be found here [Link to the testing document](static/documentation/TESTING.md)

### Errors encountered during development

* Product List pages filtered by category: 
  As I have decide to use class based view for product list page rather than Code Institute's walkthrough approach of function based view, I was unable to display using link by ?category=ring etc. As a workaround solution, I created CategoryListView and index page was replaced to ListView with category model linked. 

* Toast message not displaying when product is added to the shopping bag.
  When toast is created to display feedback messages to site user, messages were successfully displayed when an item was removed from the shopping bag hoever no messages displayed when imem is added to the bag.
  After contacting Code Institute’s tutor support, Fatima pointed out that I had a JS line in the head of the product detail page in order for the larger images to switch over on click. This script as overriding the toast script. By relocating this script line from the product detail page into the head of base.html, it successfully resolved the issue. 


### Known error present:

* Items in the bag can exceed the stock amount if the product is added separately.
  When a shopper adds an item with quantity within the stock amount and goes back to the same product page and add more of the same item, bag item quantity can exceed the available stock.
  If I had a enough time, a function to examine the quantity in the shopping bag should be implemented.

## Deployment
Here is the deployment procedure  that I have taken to deploy this project on Heroku

1. (Heroku) In the Heroku dashboard, click new, then enter the app name and specify the region.

2. (Heroku) In the Add-on section in the resources tab, search postgres, then select Heroku Postgres and submit order from button in the popup window.

3. (Heroku) In the setting tab, click on Reveal Config Vars button then copy the value for DATABASE_URL key.

4. (gitpod workspace) Create env.py directly under the repo directory same lavel as manage.py and make sure the file name is included in .gitignore to avoid the file being pushed to GitHub as this is a setting for local development site in Gitpod. 
Enter DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY with their values.
Heroku Config vars need to be set accordingly including DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY

5. (gitpod workspace) In setting.py file include followings:

        import os
        import dj_database_url
        if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
            import env
        modify SECRET_KEY line to SECRET_KEY = os.
        environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

    **Replace DATABASES as follows**

        if (development == 'True'):
          DATABASES = {
              'default': {
                  'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                  'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
              }
          }
        else:
            DATABASES = {
                'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
            }

      **For whitenoise:**

      Add following in the MIDDLEWARE list just below 'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',

        'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',

      Add another line:

        STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'


6. (In gitpod terminal) Migrate the change by
python3 manage.py migrate. Check the resource tab in heroku and choose 
Heroku Postgres then ensure the changes are reflected in the database

7. (Browser) Login to Cloudinary website and copy the API Environment variable and paste in env.py and also Config Vars in Heroku.

8. (Heroku) DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC set to 1 in Config Vars in Heroku as the initial deployment does not contain static files yet.

9. (gitpod workspace) In setting.py configure followings:
 
    * Add 'cloudinary_storage', before 'django.contrib.staticfiles', and 'cloudinary' after it.

    * Set STATICFILES_DIRS, STATICFILES_DIRS, STATIC_ROOT, MEDIA_URL and DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE so that Django can use the directories appropriately.

    * Set TEMPLATES_DIR just below BASE_DIR and insert TEMPLATES_DIR in TEMPLATES array
    'DIRS': []

    * Set ALLOWED_HOSTS array as 'tailsontrails.herokuapp.com', 'localhost'

10. (gitpod workspace) Create Procfile with the contents as follows

    web: gunicorn shinju_select.wsgi

    Commit and push the changes to GitHub

11. (Heroku) In the deployment tab in Heroku page, connect to GitHub and search for the repository then Connect.

    Click on Deploy Branch
  
  Make sure that deployment is successful without any issues in the log
